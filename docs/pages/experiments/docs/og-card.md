# OG card

<p class="description">How the docs generate og-cards</p>

## The edge function

The url `mui.com/edge-functions/og-image` can be query with 4 search parameters:

- product: The text displayed next to the MUI logo
- title: the title which can contains \* to delimit the highlighted text sections
- description: a paragraph added under the main title
- authors: the GitHub username of the authors, divided by a coma.

## Usage with markdown

By default the card will be generated by using the page title and its description.
You can override this behavior by providing `cardTitle` and `cardDescription` in the markdown header.

```markup
--
cardTitle: A *custom* title to use
cardDecription: The word "custom" is highlighted with blue
--
```
